**Mobile OS:** Android

**Unity Version:** 5.5.1f1

**Google VR Version:** 1.0

**Time to Completion:** It took about 36.5 hours to complete the project.

**What I liked:** I enjoyed making the maze and all the additions I gave to it. I felt creative and I learned a lot from doing this project on how to use Unity to develop applications on it. Making the game took a lot of hard work, but the experience was fun.

**What I found challenging:** I ran into a few challenges. At first I built my maze wrong by making the passageways too large, so it didn't fit correctly on the screen. However, once I rearranged the maze walls, it came out beautifully. I also found trouble at first to get the particles from the key and coins to shoot upwards, rather than to the side. I eventually figured out how to do it correctly, though. The biggest challenge, though, was and still is getting the framerate to an acceptable level. I put forward many hours of research to improve the framerate, but nothing I did seemed to make a substantial difference. I implemented the suggestions on Udacity's class webpage, I Googled, and I checked Unity's documentation and message boards, but even with these improvements, they still didn't help much. I think it may be because I have a lot to render on my screen, so my phone can't keep up. The game is still playable, though. It just tends to be jumpy at times.

**Additions I made to the project requirements:**
* Maze has 10 coins as collectibles
* Message on Sign Post at the end of the maze displays how many coins were found
* Waypoints turn red after traveling through them to help the player know where he/she has been
* Waypoints can't be seen unless the player is next to them
* Coins and key rotate in place, instead of remaining stationary
